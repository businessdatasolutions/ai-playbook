## Business cases

**Section 1: AI-Driven Manufacturing Optimization**

-   **Optimal Box Placement with AI**

    -   Introduce the concept: Optimizing box placement through conveyor belt adjustments.

    -   Explain Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods and their suitability for this problem.

-   **Predicting Batch Length for Scheduling**

    -   Describe the need for accurate batch length predictions.

    -   Outline how previous batch data can inform schedules to improve efficiency and resource planning.

-   **Predictive Maintenance with Servo Monitoring**

    -   Highlight the use of amperage monitoring to identify potential machine wear and tear.

    -   Discuss how proactive maintenance based on AI predictions can prevent downtime and costly repairs.

-   **IMI as an Operator Support Tool**

    -   Define IMI (you might need to explain this acronym for readers).

    -   Explain how AI can augment the IMI system to provide enhanced insights and guidance to operators.

**Section 2: AI for Smarter Sales and Service**

-   **Automated Sales Quote Generation**

    -   Describe how customers can input product requirements to receive tailored advice regarding machine solutions.
